A midi/audio sequencer program that tries to provide easy access for live performances and deep editing features to give you complete control.

It's main features are:

unlimited undo,
elastic audio (audio marker warping)
glitch-less pattern loading while playing
fast midi editor
internal sampler
internal basssynth
internal fx
LADSPA fx
Flexible track routing
Track groups
Track fx returns
Per scene fx
This project is in it's infancy and will be in alpha quality when released summer 2015. Most of the basic features are implemented. I am working on getting it into a stable state before releasing it. You should be able to work with it and the audio quality would be good enough I think.

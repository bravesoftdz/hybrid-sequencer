A midi/audio sequencer tailored to live performances.

It's main features are:

unlimited undo,<br>
elastic audio (audio marker warping)<br>
glitch-less pattern loading while playing<br>
fast midi editor<br>
internal sampler<br>
internal basssynth<br>
internal fx<br>
LADSPA fx<br>
Flexible track routing<br>
Track groups<br>
Track fx returns<br>
Per scene fx<br>
<br>
This project is in it's infancy and will be in alpha quality when released summer 2015. <br>
Most of the basic features are implemented. I am working on getting it into a stable state before releasing it. <br>
You should be able to work with it and the audio quality would be good enough I think.
